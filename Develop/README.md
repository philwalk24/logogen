## Description

This project will ask the user a series of questions using the inquirer package that when answered, will generate a .svg file containing a shape and possibly some
letters. The purpose of this program is to quickly generate a logo for a potential company. It is not quite done and still needs some work, but it does pretty much what the USER STORY asks. I will definitley be resubmitting when this is graded.

## Installation

First, you need to clone the github repo. Then, in the same folder as "index.js", you need to run two commands: "npm i install" and "npm i inquirer@^8.0.0". You will lastly need "npm i jest" for testing. Then the project can be ran. If you need more help, watch this video: 

## Usage

When its installed, you can run the project by running in the terminal: "node index.js", and then you can answer the prompts the console gives you. Once it is answered, you can view your brand new logo.

## Testing

shapes.test.js is the testing file using the jest dependancy. It tests the properties of the shapes. It is kinda barebones, but the way you use it is you go into the "stuff" directory and you run "npm test" in the console. You need to make sure your "package.json" contains this "test":"jest" in the scripts.

## Contributing

I am the only one contributing to this project; no one else can. It also can only be cloned, it wont be deployed.

## Credits

For this project, I used this stackoverflow post in order to center text in the shapes: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5546346/how-to-place-and-center-text-in-an-svg-rectangle  I also used activities from module 10 to learn how to use module.exports and classes
